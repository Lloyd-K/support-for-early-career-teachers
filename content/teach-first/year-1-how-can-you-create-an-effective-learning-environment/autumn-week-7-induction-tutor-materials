## Training session - holding high expectations of all pupils

Duration: 90 minutes.

### Session objectives

By the end of the session early career teachers (ECTs) will have: 

- reflected on the impact of ‘No Opt Out’ to increase pupil engagement 

- identified actions to further increase pupil engagement in their own classroom 

- identified suitable responses that help to develop a culture of error in the classroom 

- reflected on their own practice and identified actions to develop or enhance a culture of error 

 

### Pre-work for ECTs 

Before attending this session, ask ECTs to make sure they’re up to date with this half term’s self-study materials. 

## Session structure 

### Do now (5 minutes) 

1. Ask ECTs to work in pairs and draw upon their reflections from the online study materials. You can ask: 

- what does having high expectations around classroom conduct mean to them? 
- what are the barriers to them achieving this with their class(es)? 
- ECTs to share their thoughts with the group  

2. Address any concerns and misconceptions.  

3. Share the session objectives. 

## High expectations in practice – ‘No Opt Out’ (40 minutes) 

Holding high expectations of pupils runs throughout teaching and will be explored in each module.  

This session focuses on having high standards for pupil conduct, and setting up a classroom culture that expects pupils to think hard and participate in learning. 

You’ll focus on the concept of ‘ratio’: increasing the proportion of time that pupils are participating and thinking hard in the lesson. 

1. Recap the concept of ratio using the graph from the course. Address any questions or misconceptions the teachers have.  

2. Watch the video of the teacher using ‘No Opt Out’ and discuss how: 

- this increases participation in the classroom 
- the teacher set up the environment for a positive experience 

3. Ask ECTs to work in pairs and reflect on a time they used ‘No Opt Out’. These questions can be used as discussion prompts: 

- did you ask the question, wait, then say a pupil’s name to ensure everybody thinks?  
- was the wait time enough given the depth or complexity of the question? 
- which strategy of ‘No Opt Out’ did you use? 
- what ratio (participation and think ratio) did you achieve? 
- did the process support pupils to feel meaningful success (if so – why)? 
- did the task support you to demonstrate your high expectations of your pupils (if so – why)? 

4. Ask ECTs to share their thoughts, reflections and any next steps with the group. 

### High expectations: Creating a positive learning environment where it’s safe to make mistakes (30 minutes) 

1. Watch the video of the teacher who has created a positive environment where it’s safe to make mistakes. Ask ECTs: 

- how do you think the pupils felt during this clip? 
- what contributed to this? 
- how did the interaction ensure that the teacher held high expectations for their pupils? 
- what might the barriers have been to the teacher achieving what they did? 

2. Ask the teachers to switch pairs and discuss a range of subject or phase-specific scenarios that explore how to create a culture of error. You can use the generic scenarios below for support: 

- Mohammed is very shy and lacks confidence speaking in class. He gives an answer which is partially correct. How do you respond to Mohammed to maintain high expectations while valuing his input? 
- Chloe is outgoing in class but lacks confidence academically. She very enthusiastically gives an answer, which has fundamental errors in it. How do you respond? 
- Jasmin is an academically strong and confident pupil. She gives an answer which contains a common misconception. How do you respond? 

Reflection: Ask ECTs to reflect on and share thoughts about their own classroom culture. Prompts include: 

- what's working well? 
- what could be improved? 
- how could they increase what they’re expecting of their pupils?  
- what are their next steps? 

### Reflection and close (5 minutes) 

1. Ask ECTs to write down their concrete action steps following the session. 

2. What discussion points will they take to their mentor? 

You can close the session with thoughts, reflections and a reminder of next steps. 

The self-study materials will ask ECTs to create a combined verbal explanation and graphical representation. They need to bring this work to the next training session on avoiding working memory overload.
