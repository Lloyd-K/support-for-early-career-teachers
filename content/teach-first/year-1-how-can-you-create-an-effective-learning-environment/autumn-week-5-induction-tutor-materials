## Training session - using praise and consequences effectively

Duration: 90 minutes.

### Session objectives

By the end of the session early career teachers (ECTs) will have: 

- further explored the difference between praise and acknowledgment 

- explored how to use praise precisely 

- identified one way to improve the praise they currently give 

- identified ways to demonstrate a respectful and trusting relationship, and maintain high expectations, when tackling behaviour incidents in the classroom  

 ### Pre-work for ECTs 

Before attending this session, ask ECTs to make sure they’re up to date with this half term’s self-study materials. 

## Session structure 

### Ice breaker to start the first session (5 minutes) 

Ask ECTs to introduce themselves, say where they work, and share the subject or year group they work in. 

Explain how these training sessions will run and who to contact if they have questions. 

### Review of learning (5 minutes) 

Address any questions ECTs have about the online self-study materials. Some areas may be covered by the content of this training session. If not, make time at the end to address any further queries. 

Share the objectives of this session. 

### Praise and acknowledgement (20 minutes) 

1. What's the difference between praise and acknowledgement?  

2. What is precise praise? You may wish to show the videos of precise praise being used to enhance your explanations. 

3. Activity: present ECTs with a variety of scenarios. Ask them to work in pairs or small groups to explore a different scenario each. Encourage them to: 

- identify whether they would use acknowledgment or praise for their scenario  

- record the language they would use to indicate this 

- if the scenario requires praise, consider how they'd make the praise precise? 

Discuss and address any misconceptions. Draw on examples where teachers have used particularly effective precise praise and discuss further. 

### Reflection (10 minutes) 

Ask ECTs to reflect on their own practice of using praise. This could be based on a recording they took of themselves teaching, or discussions they’ve had with their mentor. 

ECTs should:  

1. Identify one strength and one area to develop. 

2. Discuss how to develop this with peers. 

3. Feed back to group. 

### Being respectful and building trust whilst maintaining expectations and standards in regard to classroom management (30 minutes) 

1. Ask what it means to have a respectful approach to classroom management.

2. Ask how this is different to using your authority to exert power and control. 

3. Recap the key messages from the online study materials.

4. Ask teachers to discuss key messages. Take feedback and address any misconceptions. 

5. Share how these concepts relate to the school’s approach to behaviour and the behaviour policy.   

6. Read through one scenario where a pupil has demonstrated disruptive behaviour, and how a teacher has responded to this.  

7. Activity: Ask ECTs to work in pairs and discuss the impact this might have had on the pupil and the rest of the class. Would they do anything differently? Encourage them to share with the group.   

8. Activity: Still in pairs, ask ECTs to explore a variety of scenarios and responses to different disruptive behaviour. What might the consequences and impact be? Discuss the best course of action.  

9. Remind ECTs that they have a right to support from colleagues, including the senior leadership team, when dealing with behaviour management. 

### Reflection (5 minutes) 

1. Ask ECTs to reflect on their own practice and consider: 

- has there been a time when they haven't responded in the way they wanted to?  

- what was the impact on the pupil and the class?  

- has there been a time where they responded in the way they are wanting to?  

- what was the impact on the pupil and the class?   

2. Encourage ECTs to identify one strength and one area for development to build on what they’re already doing in the classroom. Discuss how they can develop this with peers, and feedback to the group.   

3. Share how the school and mentors can further support ECTs with their next steps.  

### Actions and next steps (5 minutes) 

Ask ECTs to reflect on the learning from the session and record their actions and next steps related to their classroom practice. Options include revisiting certain areas of the course, talking with their mentor, watching another teacher, planning to adapt their practice, and more.
