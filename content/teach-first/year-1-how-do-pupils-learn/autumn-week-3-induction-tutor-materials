## Training session - avoiding working memory overload

Duration: 90 minutes.

### Session objectives

By the end of the session early career teachers (ECTs) will have: 

- reflected on their own practice regarding managing pupils’ working memory load 
- critically reviewed examples of combined explanation and graphical representation in practice 
- developed a worked example for an upcoming lesson using a success criterion 

### Pre-work for ECTs 

Before attending this session, ask ECTs to: 

- make sure they’re up to date with this half term’s self-study materials 

- bring an example of how they’ve combined verbal explanation and graphical representation  

## Session structure

### Introduce the session and share the session objectives (5 minutes) 

Recap what working memory overload is. You could use [Daniel T. Willingham’s diagram of the brain](https://moodrmoo.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/why-dont-students-like-school.pdf)to support your recap. 

Ask ECTs to share their reflections on: 

- when have they caused working memory overload for their pupils? 
- what caused this? 
- what was the impact on pupils? 
- was the impact equal for all pupils?  
- who, if anyone, was most affected? 

### Combining verbal explanation and graphical representation (30 minutes) 

1. Recap on how combining verbal explanation with graphical representation can reduce working memory overload. Share some examples from your own practice or from relevant literature. 

2. Share the following success criteria: 

The diagram has been chosen or created by the teacher because it: 

- supports understanding of the concept 
- is clear and visible to pupils 
- has a clear supporting explanation, allowing pupils to understand the concept 

3. Ask teachers to work in pairs to share their example of combined verbal and graphical representations. They should use the success criteria to review it and improve it where possible. 

4. Circulate and address any misconceptions.  

5. Ask some or all ECTs to share their work and reflect on how well it meets the success criteria. 

### Worked or partially completed examples (45 minutes) 

1. Recap on what worked and partially completed examples are.  

2. Explain that they can be used during explanations to reduce the chances of working memory overload. Share an example from your own practice. 

3. Activity: Ask ECTs to work in pairs and consider an upcoming topic they’ll teach. They should each create a worked or partially completed example to support pupils’ working memory load. Discussion prompts include: 

- how would the worked example support you to teach your pupils what you want them to learn? 

- how would the worked or partially completed example support you to manage your pupils’ working memory load? 

- how might you reduce the level of support over time?   

4. Circulate and address any misconceptions.  

5. Choose a good example and ask the ECT to share it. Ask them to answer the prompt questions.  

### Recap the session objectives (5 minutes) 

Answer any queries or questions. 

The self-study materials will ask ECTs to add spaced and retrieval practice to a topic. They need to bring this work to the next training session on building well organised mental models.

- 2.4 Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded. 

- 2.9: Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new process are also likely to support pupils to learn. 

- 2b: Breaking complex material into smaller steps (using partially completed examples to focus pupils on the specific steps, for example). 

- 4g: Combining a verbal explanation with a relevant graphical representation of the same concept or process, where appropriate.
