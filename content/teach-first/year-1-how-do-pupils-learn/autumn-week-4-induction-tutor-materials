## Training session - building well organised mental models

Duration: 90 minutes.

### Session objectives

By the end of the session early career teachers (ECTs) will have: 

- reviewed their example of spaced and retrieval practice created during their self-study time 
- considered how to create or improve retrieval practice as part of their own curriculum 
- created a retrieval activity they can use in their practice 

### Recap (5 minutes) 

- the concept of a mental model
- why spaced and retrieval practice support the building of long-term memory 

### Review the ECTs examples of spaced and retrieval practice (20 minutes) 

1. Ask ECTs to work in pairs and share the examples they created during their self study. 

Discuss: 

- where and why they incorporated spaced practice 
- where and why they incorporated retrieval practice  

2. Circulate and address any misconceptions.  

3. Choose a good example and ask the ECT to share it, along with their answers to the discussion points.  

### Plan retrieval practice into an upcoming unit of work (55 minutes) 

1. Ask ECTs to work in pairs or groups to plan retrieval practice into an upcoming unit of work.  

If this is already common practice in the school, use this time to review what’s planned and assess how well it supports pupils’ learning.  

ECTs should consider the following success criteria:  

- you have time in your lessons to review learning after around a week, and then at monthly intervals 
- the retrieval task asks the pupils to retrieve information from memory 
- the retrieval task relates to the core concepts of the subject matter covered (determined by the ECT’s subject or phase) 

2. ECTs should discuss: 

- where have you incorporated retrieval practice and why?  
- what task would form the basis of the retrieval practice(s) and why have you chosen it or them?  

3. Circulate and address any misconceptions.  

4. Choose a good example and ask the ECT to share it, along with their answers to the discussion points. 

### Recap the session objectives (5 minutes) 

Answer any queries or questions. 

Look ahead to the next term’s topic.

- 2i:Planning regular review and practice of key ideas and concepts over time. 

- 3.7 In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.
